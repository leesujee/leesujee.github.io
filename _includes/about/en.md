Hi, I am _@leesujee_ (Sujee, Ikeda).
I`m UI・UX designer.
My interests range from web/mobile app, user interface and UX.

“When the point of contact between the product and the people becomes a point of friction, then the designer has failed.On the other hand, if people are made safer, more comfortable, more eager to purchase, more efficient – or just plain happier – by contact with the product, then the designer has succeeded.”

Henry Dreyfuss (Designing for People, 1955)
